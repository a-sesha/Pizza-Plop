# Pizza-Plop
An 80s Arcade Game

Pizza Plop is an arcade-style game programmed in Java in which the player directs falling pizza toppings onto different pizzas depending on what each customer orders. Points are scored for each completed pizza, but the player is forced to throw away a pizza as soon as an incorrect topping is put on it. Additionally, the player is penalized with a lost life in two different scenarios, either a) when a customer becomes so impatient that they leave before their pizza is completed or b) when poison is dropped into a customerâ€™s pizza at any point. The player is rewarded with bonus points for being quick, and the pace of the game speeds up as time goes on, making for some truly hectic gameplay.
